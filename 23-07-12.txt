Notes on leet_27:
- The biggest issue I ran into again is edge cases
- When trying to solve them rather than step back and ask what I was specifically trying to solve I just started trying to spam the debugger
    - the correct thing would have been to:
        - stop
        - step back
        - write the problem
        - come up with a solution
        - review
        - implement
    - the reason these steps are important is that when you just spam the debugger you don't actually understand what the solution is you are just trying to make
    it "work"
    - most of the time you end up spending the same amount of time due to banging your head against the wall
- be more mythodical
- it might have been more benificial to actually write the function before testing it with the unit tests
    - the reason I say this is because I wasted a bunch of time trying to figure out how to debug a second child process. It may also be easier to just run 1 test
    and use loops rather then multiple tests simply for debugging purposes. Again though it may be better to be forced to stop and think.
        - we aren't trying to optimize for time yet but for thought and understanding

Notes on gdbgui:
- it works but itsn't an optimal work flow
- the primary things I want is to see variables, to see memory ranges, and to see a full source file as you are debugging

Night notes:
- vim has built in debugger support using Termdebug
    - this opens two more windows one to print what the program does and another to interact with gdb
    - you can execute commands from within vim although I don't love how it works so the workflow is still not there
    - using watch in gdb is super useful, but I haven't lookedup up how to clear it yet.
