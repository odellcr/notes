gdb notes:
b <filename>:<ln> sets a breakpoint
c or run will run to the next breakpoint
start will set a breakpoint at beginning of main
set follow-fork-mode <child, parent> will allow for debugging the desired process after the fork() is done

tmux:
'tmux' starts the program
ctrl + b is the prefix
cb , % will split vertically
cb, " will split horizontally
cb, alt + arrow keys can be used to resize
cb, o switches to other session
cb, arrow keys can be used to directionally switch

unit framework calls a child process for each test which is kind of annoying for debugging.
need to figure out what the barebones is for this so I don't have to copy paste each time.
